Applied Data Science Capstone by IBM/Coursera


***1. Introduction: Business Problem***

The aim of this project is to find places to visit in Tiraa, Albania. As the data availables on Foursquare about places in Tirana are few, we will limit this report to toursits and investors. The targeted stakeholders would be people from around the world interested in visiting any city in Albania. The data can be used to analyze aswell the potential of some city for investors that are willing to open any business in a specific city. 

The first task would be to analyse the  places of the highest interest for tourists based on the information available on Foursquare in combination with some data found on Google.

We will make use of our data science tools to analyse data, focus and explore the 15 most known places in the capital city of Albania.


***2. Data***

*Based on what is our problem, factors that will influence are:*

  -> finding the most populated city in the country (top 10) (csv file : https://simplemaps.com/data/al-cities).
  
  -> extract the lat and lng of the top 15 places in Tirana.
  
  -> search for each location the main venues listed by Foursquare.
  
  -> Analyzes the top 15 place in each city is very interesting because it will tell us the trends of each city. 
  
  -> Performing a clustering to visualize the groups of the highest rated places in the city.
  
Based on all the analysis that we will make, the toursits can have a wide view of which city has the most to offer to them. 
In addition to this, an enterpreneur can have a precise vision about what are the places and activities that attract more in a specific city in albania. With this  kind of information we can guess what activites (business oppurtunities) are missing in a city.
